# KO + D3

Just playing around wiht D3.js and Knockout.js

I'm using Parcel as a task manager, but you do you.

## Instructions
Basic npm commands for building and starting - Parcel will do the rest:

`$ npm start`

`$ npm run build`

_Uses port 1234_

## Tools
 * Bulma for Style
 * Parcel as a task manager / bundler
 * Knockout.js as a JS framework
 * D3 for some super sweet animations
