# D3 on the Distributed Web

Just playing around with webGL and [Dat](https://datproject.org)

I'm using Parcel as a task manager, but you do you.

I wrote about this experience on [medium](http://medium.com/@blakeface)

## Instructions for http
Basic npm commands for building and starting - Parcel will do the rest:

`$ npm start`

`$ npm run build-http`

_Uses port 1234_

## Instructions for Dat

To sync:
`$ npm run build-dat`

## Tools
 * Parcel as a task manager / bundler
 * Three.js for some super sweet animations
 * Dat to serve on the distributed web
