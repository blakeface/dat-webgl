# KO + D3

Just playing around wiht D3.js and Knockout.js

I'm using Parcel as a task manager, but you do you.

## Instructions
**Start:**

`$ npm start`

**Build**

`$ npm run build`


## Tools
 * Bulma for Style
 * Parcel as a task manager / bundler
 * Knockout.js as a JS framework
 * D3 for some super sweet animations
